This directory contains source for snappy and an Xcode project and script to build it.

Snappy is available from http://code.google.com/p/snappy/

This source was acquired as release 1.1.0 from

http://code.google.com/p/snappy/downloads/detail?name=snappy-1.1.0.tar.gz

The only change to the source has been to remove the testdata directory.

A patch is applied to restore snappy 1.0's 32 kB block size. 1.1's 64 kB blocks give slower decompression.

The script build-snappy.sh is run from within Xcode to build a 32-bit version of the library suitable for use by the Hap codec.
