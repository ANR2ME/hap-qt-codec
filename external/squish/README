This directory contains source for squish and an Xcode project and script to build it.

Squish is available from http://code.google.com/p/libsquish/

This source was acquired at revision 44 thus:

svn export -r 44 http://libsquish.googlecode.com/svn/trunk squish-source

The only change to the source has been to remove the test and images directories.

The script build-squish.sh is run from within Xcode to build a 32-bit version of the library suitable for use by the vpup codec.
